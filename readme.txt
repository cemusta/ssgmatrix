SSG's Matrix Screensaver v1.01
==============================

How to install:

1) Copy SSSSGMatrix.scr file to your Windows directory (probably C:\WINDOWS)
2) Install the Matrix Code Font if you haven't done it already.

Changes:

v1.01

+ added multi monitor support
+ optimized code a lot. should work fast on almost all systems.
+ mouse clicks cause screensaver to close now (thanks goes to detay)
+ small fixes (aka "there was something but i don't remember")

v1.00

+ released (and for a time, it was good)

Why:

Because ZMatrix (zmatrix.sourceforge.net) was very much bloated and it didn't 
work the way I want. I just wanted a matrix screensaver, not a world saviour.
(What was that Winamp vis plugin anyway!?)
It's also been coded very bad (habit of C++ coders I guess) so I couldn't 
get to fix it.

I couldn't get the original matrix screensaver code by Louai Munajim 
(http://www.elouai.com) work with Matrix Code Font either. Too low level, 
needs too much time.

So I coded one from scratch in Delphi in half an hour which was faster than
fixing any code.

My first screensaver.
No silly configuration settings.
Works only with "Matrix Code Font" font.
May not work at all.

There is some fiction in your truth,
and some truth in your fiction.
